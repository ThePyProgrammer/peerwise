<p>To calculate this, you must use the formula F = (1/4&pi;&epsilon;0) * (Qq/r<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Here, we know that Q and q are both equal to q<sub>o</sub>, which you already know as a constant, but the direction may change based on the charge of the charges dropped by the "Charged-Particle-inator".</p>
<p>Thus, you extract it as F = (q<sub>o</sub>/4&pi;&epsilon;0) * 1/r<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>To calculate r<sup>2</sup>, what you do is you calculate based on the points as given. From this we have r<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2n</sup> + k<sup>2n</sup> = 2k<sup>2n</sup>.<sup><br /></sup></p>
<p>We thus derive a series representing the force exhibited for the positive direction (i.e. x and y are both positive) F<sub>1</sub> =&nbsp;(q<sub>o</sub>/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>) * (1/2k<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;+ 1/2k<sup>2</sup> + 1/2k<sup>4</sup> + ....), which faces south-west.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we can also derive a similar&nbsp;series representing the force exhibited for the positive direction (i.e. x and y are both positive) F<sub>2</sub> = (q<sub>o</sub>/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>) * (1/2k<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;- 1/2k<sup>2</sup> + 1/2k<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;- ....), which faces south-west as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We add these two forces up and we get F<sub>net</sub> =&nbsp;(q<sub>o</sub>/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>) *&nbsp;(1/k<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;+ 1/k<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;+ 1/k<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;+ ....), which faces south-west.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I would like to divert to derive an expression for S = 1/k<sup>0</sup> + 1/k<sup>4</sup> + 1/k<sup>8</sup> + ...</p>
<p>To do this, we derive k<sup>4</sup>S = k<sup>4</sup> + 1/k<sup>0</sup> + 1/k<sup>4</sup> + .... = k<sup>4</sup> + S</p>
<p>From this, we get S = k<sup>4</sup>/(k<sup>4</sup> - 1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now substituting back in, we get F<sub>net</sub> =&nbsp;(q<sub>o</sub>/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>) * (k<sub>4</sub>/(k<sub>4</sub> - 1)) = ma</p>
<p>:. a =&nbsp;(q<sub>o</sub>/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>) * (k<sup>4</sup>/m(k<sup>4</sup> - 1)), facing south-west</p>
