### Question
Let's say you have an infinite stream of electrons spaced s = 1mm apart. These electrons are initially charged with an initial kinetic energy of E<sub>k</sub> = 20keV. These electrons enter a changing magnetic field ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_1%20=%20B_o\sqrt{e^{t^2-1}%2B5}), where B<sub>o</sub> = 2.3232323232...T facing out of the page. Certainly, we can therefore gather that the stream tilts upwards, but let's just assume the radius r is constant.

After a time T = 5s, this stream exits the magnetic field to move an arbitrary distance upwards to enter a wire loop of mass M = 16kg and diameter d = 3cm. After exiting the loop, the electrons just leave to an electron storage, never to be seen again. Now, once there is assured to be absolutely no change in the current of the loop, a uniform magnetic field B<sub>2</sub> = 2.1111111...T facing downwards perpendicular to the electrons' motion before entering the loop is placed on the loop, and a torque is therefore exerted. Find the angular velocity of the loop when it rotates exactly ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\pi}{2}) radians.
