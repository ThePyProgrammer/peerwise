# CM4131 Chapter 7

My revision notes for Chapter 7.



## Uniqueness Principle

-  Small Cations are highly polarizing
  - high charge/volume ratio
  - readily polarizes the electron cloud of anion
  - increases orbital overlap between Li<sup>+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> orbitals
  - **a strong covalent character**
  - stronger and thus it becomes very difficult to break bond to form
    - Solubility reduced
- Carbon cannot expand its octet
  - forming sp<sup>3</sup>d or sp<sup>3</sup>d<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals
  - requires the mixing of 2p and 3d orbitals
  - energetically too far apart
  - energetically not accessible
- Si can't form strong pi bonds
  - with O:
    - **Energy** and **Size** **Mismatch/ Difference**
    - Not able to overlap sideways effectively
    - Si-O pi bond is weak
  - with Si:
    - Orbitals are **large and diffuse**
    - Large electron cloud
    - Not able to overlap sideways effectively
    - Si-Si pi bond is weak

## Diagonal Effect

- As we go **down the group**, the element properties change
  - size increases, electronegativity decreases, less covalent, more basic
- as we do **across the period**, the properties change in the opposite trend
  - size decreases, electronegativity increase, more covalent, less basic
- As such for the diagonal molecules have similar chemical properties
  - Li and Mg
  - Be and Al
  - B and Si



## Lewis Acids and Bases

- Lewis Acid: electron pair acceptor
- Lewis Base: electron pair donor
- Product is called Adduct
  - 4 dative covalent bonds
- Strength of Acid:
  - Less Electronegative
  - More readily donates its Lone Pair
- Displacement reaction
  - Stronger Lewis Acid Displaces Weaker Lewis Acid from its Adduct



## Inert-Pair Effect

- Tl and In form Monochloride compounds
  - d and f orbitals are poor at shielding
  - the *s* electrons of In and Tl experience a larger effective nuclear charge.
  - Bigger atoms form Long covalent bond 
    - Lower Bond Energy
  - Thus *s* electrons are not easily promoted to *p* orbital (and the energy it require is high) and not easily form bonds (as energy released  is low); 
  - not easily form sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid (like B or Al).      



## p<sub>π</sub>-d<sub>π</sub> Interaction

- Pi bond formed by the side-on overlap of unhybridized p orbital and unhybridized d orbital.
